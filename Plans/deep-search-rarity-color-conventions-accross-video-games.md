# Rarity color conventions across video games: gold vs. orange

**Gold and orange both occupy the "legendary" slot in gaming's color hierarchy, but they are technically different colors serving the same cultural role.** The dominant convention, established by World of Warcraft in 2004, uses **orange (#FF8000)** for legendary items — yet players universally call it "gold" because of gold's association with value. For Project Flutter's cozy context, **gold is the stronger choice** for a top-tier badge, aligning with how farming and collection games handle quality while still reading instantly as "highest tier" to any gamer.

## The WoW standard that conquered gaming

The modern rarity color system traces a clear lineage: **Angband** (1990) invented color-coded items, **Diablo** (1996) popularized the concept for mainstream audiences, and **World of Warcraft** (2004) locked in the specific sequence that became industry canon. That sequence — **Gray → White → Green → Blue → Purple → Orange** — now functions as a universal visual language across genres.

WoW's exact hex values tell the story precisely. Poor items render in gray (#9d9d9d), Common in white, Uncommon in bright green (#1eff00), Rare in blue (#0070dd), Epic in purple (#a335ee), and Legendary in **pure orange (#ff8000)**. The game later added a separate Artifact tier in a distinctly different **pale gold (#e6cc80)**, proving that Blizzard itself treats orange and gold as different colors occupying different tiers. This distinction matters: WoW's legendary is unambiguously orange, not gold, not yellow.

The convention proved so effective that it now appears in games across every genre. The five-tier core pattern (gray/white → green → blue → purple → orange/gold) has become what TV Tropes calls "Color-Coded Item Tiers" — a trope so pervasive that players feel disoriented when games break it.

## Game-by-game breakdown of every major rarity system

The table below documents exact colors used across 20+ major titles, organized by the color of their highest standard tier:

### Games using ORANGE for the top tier

| Game | Tier Progression (lowest → highest) |
|------|--------------------------------------|
| **World of Warcraft** | Gray (Poor) → White (Common) → Green (Uncommon) → Blue (Rare) → Purple (Epic) → **Orange** (Legendary) |
| **Diablo 3** | Gray → White → Blue (Magic) → Yellow (Rare) → Green (Set) → **Orange** (Legendary) |
| **Diablo 4** | White → Blue → Yellow (Rare) → **Orange** (Legendary) → Tan/Brown (Unique) |
| **Borderlands 1–4** | White → Green → Blue → Purple → **Orange** (Legendary) |
| **Core Keeper** | Gray (Poor) → White (Common) → Green → Blue → Pink/Magenta (Epic) → **Orange** (Legendary) |
| **Minecraft Dungeons** | White (Common) → Green (Rare) → **Orange** (Unique) |
| **Moonlighter 2** | Gray → Green → Blue → Purple → **Orange** (Legendary) |

### Games using GOLD or YELLOW for the top tier

| Game | Tier Progression (lowest → highest) |
|------|--------------------------------------|
| **Destiny / Destiny 2** | White → Green → Blue → Purple (Legendary) → **Yellow/Gold** (Exotic) |
| **Genshin Impact** | Gray (1★) → Green (2★) → Blue (3★) → Purple (4★) → **Gold** (5★) |
| **Apex Legends** | White → Blue → Purple → **Gold** (Legendary) → Red (Mythic) |
| **Fortnite** | Gray → Green → Blue → Purple → **Orange-Gold** (Legendary) → Gold (Mythic) |

### Games with non-standard systems

| Game | System | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| **Path of Exile** | White → Blue → Yellow → Brown/Dark Orange (Unique) | Follows the Diablo lineage; skips green and purple entirely |
| **Diablo 2** | Gray → White → Blue → Yellow → Green → Orange (Crafted) → **Gold** (Unique) | Yellow for Rare is a Diablo-family quirk |
| **Terraria** | 16 tiers from Gray through White, Blue, Green, Orange, Light Red, Pink, Light Purple, Lime, Yellow, Cyan, Red, Purple | Completely unique progression; no single "legendary" color |
| **Monster Hunter** | Rare 1–12 with colors cycling through White, Green, Pink, Blue, Orange, Cyan, Yellow, Purple, Red | Numbers matter more than colors; no standard hierarchy |
| **Pokémon TCG** | Symbol-based (●, ◆, ★) with gold stars for highest rarity | Not color-coded in the traditional sense |
| **League of Legends** | Teal (Epic) → Red (Legendary) → Orange (Ultimate) → Purple (Mythic) → Gold (Exalted) | Deliberately non-standard tier colors |

## Orange dominates the action genre; gold owns the "prestige" feeling

Across all games studied, a clear pattern emerges. **Orange is the more common specific color for legendary-tier items** in loot-driven action games — WoW, Diablo 3/4, Borderlands, Core Keeper, and Minecraft Dungeons all use it. These are games where you need to instantly distinguish loot on the ground at a glance, and orange's high saturation and contrast against dark backgrounds makes it ideal for that purpose.

**Gold appears more often in games emphasizing prestige and aspiration** — Genshin Impact's 5-star pulls shower the screen in golden light, Destiny's Exotic engrams glow warm yellow, and Apex Legends' gold items carry a metallic sheen. These games use gold specifically because it evokes luxury, achievement, and precious metal. The distinction is subtle but real: orange says "rare loot," while gold says "you earned something special."

The confusion between the two is widespread and documented. WoW's #FF8000 is technically pure orange, yet the gaming community routinely calls it "gold." A well-known analysis from the Tales of the Aggronaut blog theorizes that "yellow at some point became gold" in community parlance because Diablo 1 originally used true gold for its top tier, and the cultural label persisted even as the actual color shifted toward orange in later games. Even **Magic: The Gathering** mirrors this split: Rare cards have **gold** expansion symbols while Mythic Rares use **red-orange**.

## Cozy and farming games rarely use rarity colors at all

This finding is perhaps the most relevant for Project Flutter. **Most cozy and farming games avoid WoW-style rarity color tiers entirely**, preferring systems that feel less loot-grind and more craftsmanship-oriented:

**Stardew Valley** uses a quality star system — no star, silver star, gold star, iridium/purple star — where the progression through metallic colors (silver → gold → purple) conveys increasing quality without the "loot game" feel. **Graveyard Keeper** follows the same pattern with bronze, silver, and gold stars. **My Time at Sandrock** uses a partial WoW scheme (white → green → blue → purple) but deliberately stops at purple with no orange or gold tier. **APICO**, **Ooblets**, **Slime Rancher**, **Animal Crossing**, **Astroneer**, and **Bugsnax** have no color-coded rarity system whatsoever.

The one exception is **Moonlighter 2**, a cozy-adjacent dungeon crawler that implements the exact WoW convention (gray → green → blue → purple → orange). But Moonlighter is explicitly a loot-selling game, making the convention contextually appropriate.

The pattern is clear: **cozy games that do indicate quality levels gravitate toward metallic colors (bronze/silver/gold) rather than the WoW spectrum**. This makes gold feel native to the cozy genre in a way that orange does not.

## Project Flutter should keep gold

Project Flutter's current scheme — **Brown (L1) → Green (L2) → Blue (L3) → Purple (L4) → Gold (L5)** — is well-designed for three reasons.

First, **the green → blue → purple → gold core is instantly readable** to anyone familiar with gaming rarity conventions. It maps cleanly to the Uncommon → Rare → Epic → Legendary mental model. The substitution of brown for gray/white at level 1 is a smart genre-appropriate choice that evokes earth and soil — fitting for a garden game.

Second, **gold is the correct choice over orange for a cozy game**. The data shows that cozy and farming games that do use quality indicators consistently use metallic colors (silver, gold, iridium). Stardew Valley's gold star is arguably the single most recognized quality indicator in the cozy genre. Gold communicates "highest achievement" with warmth and prestige, while orange carries the visual connotation of action-loot games like Borderlands and Diablo. For an insect garden game, gold reads as a precious, earned reward; orange would read as a random legendary drop.

Third, **gold and orange are functionally interchangeable in the rarity slot**. Players recognize both as "top tier" — the difference is tonal, not structural. Since roughly half of major games use gold-leaning colors (Genshin, Destiny, Apex, Fortnite's Mythic tier) and half use orange (WoW, Borderlands, Diablo 3), neither choice breaks convention. The question is which tone fits the game's identity, and for a cozy insect garden, gold wins decisively.

## Conclusion

The gaming industry has no single "correct" color for its highest rarity tier — it has two closely related options that serve different emotional registers. **Orange (#FF8000) is the WoW-codified technical standard**, dominant in action-RPGs and looter-shooters where instant visual recognition of ground loot matters. **Gold is the prestige variant**, favored by gacha games, cozy games, and titles that want their top tier to feel earned rather than found. Project Flutter's brown → green → blue → purple → gold progression threads the needle perfectly: it leverages the universal rarity color language while matching the warm, aspirational tone that cozy game players expect. Changing gold to orange would technically align closer to WoW's hex code but would sacrifice the genre-appropriate feel that makes the current palette work.
