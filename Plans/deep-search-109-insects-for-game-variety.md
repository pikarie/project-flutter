## 1. Butterflies (Papillons) — 20 species

Butterflies form the core collectible category and the game's most recognizable insects. The selection spans five continents, four rarity tiers, and three movement families — flutter, glide, and erratic — ensuring visual and behavioral variety across all zones.

### Common rarity

| # | Common Name | French Name | Size | Key Visual (32–48px) | Plants/Habitat | Movement | Photo Diff. | Active | Zone |
|---|-------------|-------------|------|----------------------|----------------|----------|-------------|--------|------|
| 1 | Cabbage White | Piéride du chou | Small | White wings, 1–2 black dots | Brassicas, nasturtiums | Flutter | Easy | Day | Starter Garden |
| 2 | Painted Lady | Belle-Dame | Medium | Orange-brown, black patches, white forewing tips | Thistles, hollyhocks, buddleia | Flutter | Easy | Day | Meadow |
| 3 | Clouded Sulphur | Coliade du trèfle | Small | Bright lemon-yellow, thin black borders | Clover, alfalfa | Flutter | Easy | Day | Starter Garden |
| 4 | Common Blue | Azuré commun | Small | Males vivid violet-blue; females brown with orange | Bird's-foot trefoil, clover | Flutter | Medium | Day | Meadow |
| 5 | Orange Tip | Aurore | Small | Males white with vivid orange wingtips; females white | Garlic mustard, cuckooflower | Flutter | Medium | Day | Starter Garden |

**Fun facts:**
- **Cabbage White** — Accidentally introduced to North America around 1860; now one of the continent's most widespread butterflies.
- **Painted Lady** — The world's most widespread butterfly, found on every continent except Antarctica and South America. Some migrate over 9,000 miles round-trip.
- **Clouded Sulphur** — Almost never opens its wings while resting, so catching the bright yellow uppersides requires in-flight photography.
- **Common Blue** — Caterpillars produce sweet honeydew that attracts ants, who guard them from predators in return.
- **Orange Tip** — Only males have the signature orange wingtips; the female looks so different she was once classified as a separate species.

|---|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|--------|-------------|--------|------|
| 1 | Marmalade Hoverfly | Syrphe ceinturé | Small; orange abdomen with alternating thick/thin black bands | Hover (classic stationary hover + sudden darts) | Common | Medium | Day | Starter Garden |
| 2 | Drone Fly | Éristale gluante | Stocky honeybee mimic; dark brown with orange patches | Hover | Common | Easy | Day | Pond Edge |
| 3 | Bee Fly | Grand bombyle | Round, fluffy, tawny-brown; long rigid forward-pointing proboscis | Hover (with dangling legs) | Uncommon | Medium | Day | Forest/Woodland |
| 4 | Robber Fly | Asile | Large, angular; bristly "mustache" face, powerful spiny legs | Darting (ambush from perch) | Uncommon | Medium | Day | Meadow |
| 5 | Crane Fly | Tipule | Extremely long dangling legs, slender mosquito-like but harmless | Flutter (clumsy, bouncing) | Common | Easy | Dawn-dusk | Starter Garden |
| 6 | Long-Legged Fly | Dolichopode | Tiny; brilliant metallic green, very long legs, red eyes | Skitter (rapid leaf-surface runs) | Common | Hard | Day | Pond Edge |

**Standout fun facts:**
- **Marmalade Hoverfly** — Millions migrate from northern Europe to the Mediterranean each autumn, rivaling butterfly migrations.
- **Drone Fly** — Mimics honeybee drones so well it fools most people, but it has no stinger and only one pair of wings. Its larvae ("rat-tailed maggots") breathe through a snorkel tube in polluted water.
- **Bee Fly** — Females flick eggs toward solitary bee burrow entrances while hovering; the hatching larvae sneak inside to devour bee grubs.
- **Robber Fly** — Aerial assassins that catch prey mid-flight with spiny legs and inject paralyzing saliva.
- **Long-Legged Fly** — Males perform elaborate courtship dances, waving legs tipped with inflated silvery-white paddles.

## 9. Other fascinating insects — 15 species

This catch-all category covers **camouflage specialists**, **aquatic surface-dwellers**, **ambush predators**, and **ephemeral beauties** that enrich specific zones.

| # | Common Name | French Name | Key Visual | Movement | Rarity | Photo Diff. | Active | Zone |
|---|-------------|-------------|------------|----------|--------|-------------|--------|------|
| 1 | Chinese Mantis | Mante chinoise | Very large (11 cm); green or tan, triangular head, prayer pose | Crawl (slow stalk, sudden strike) | Uncommon | Medium | Day | Starter Garden |
| 2 | European Mantis | Mante religieuse | Medium (6–7 cm); bright green; black-ringed white bullseye under forelegs | Crawl | Uncommon | Medium | Day | Herb Garden |
| 3 | Orchid Mantis | Mante orchidée | Stunning white-pink, petal-shaped legs, flower camouflage | Crawl (gentle swaying) | Legendary | Hard | Day | Tropical Greenhouse |

| 15 | Mayfly | Éphémère | Pale yellow-cream; large upright transparent sail wings; long thread tails | Flutter (rising-falling dance) | Uncommon | Medium | Dawn-dusk | Pond Edge |

**Standout fun facts:**
- **Orchid Mantis** — Research shows it attracts MORE pollinators than actual flowers; its UV reflection is indistinguishable from real petals to insects.
- **Walking Stick** — Females can reproduce without males (parthenogenesis) and drop eggs from treetops like tiny seeds.
- **Leaf Insect** — Even its eggs look like plant seeds; newly hatched nymphs mimic dead leaves before turning green.
- **Periodical Cicada** — Spends **13 or 17 years** underground (both prime numbers, thought to avoid predator synchronization), then emerges in billions.
- **Water Strider** — Legs covered in thousands of microscopic water-repellent hairs; it reads ripples to detect prey.
- **Whirligig Beetle** — Has split eyes: the top half sees above water and the bottom half below, simultaneously. Defensive chemical smells like apples.
- **Earwig** — Despite the myth, they don't crawl into ears. Females are devoted mothers, guarding eggs through winter — rare behavior among non-social insects.
- **Mayfly** — Adults have no functional mouth. The French name "éphémère" literally means "ephemeral."
- **Green Lacewing** — Larvae ("aphid lions") devour **200+ aphids per week** and camouflage themselves by stacking the corpses of victims on their backs.

## 10. New zone designs unlock distinct insect families

The current three zones (Starter Garden, Meadow, Pond Edge) should expand to **13 total zones** unlocked progressively. Each zone is visually distinct and opens access to insect families unavailable elsewhere.

| Order | Zone | Visual Hook | Key Unique Insects | Special Mechanic |
|-------|------|------------|--------------------|------------------|
| 1 | Starter Garden | Cottage garden, picket fence, flower beds | Cabbage White, Honeybee, Ladybug, Earwig | Tutorial — core photography |
| 2 | Meadow | Rolling wildflower field, golden grasses | Monarch, Painted Lady, Grasshoppers | Wind sway affecting flight paths |
| 3 | Pond Edge | Lily pads, reeds, still water | Blue Dasher, Water Strider, Azure Damselfly | Reflection photography bonus |
| 4 | **Herb Garden** | Raised beds of lavender, rosemary, thyme; brick paths, sundial | Black Swallowtail, Rosemary Beetle, Wool Carder Bee, Mint Moth | **Scent trails** — fragrance visualized as colored swirls guiding insects. Companion planting bonuses |
| 5 | **Forest Floor** | Dappled sunlight, mossy logs, fern fronds, mushrooms, bluebells | Stag Beetle, Luna Moth, Mourning Cloak, Walking Stick | **Leaf litter layer** — brush aside leaves to reveal hidden beetles. Sunbeam mechanic: certain butterflies appear only in shifting light patches |
| 6 | **Compost/Log Pile** | Steaming compost heap, stacked mossy logs, bracket fungi | Rhinoceros Beetle, Rose Chafer, Mole Cricket, Click Beetle | **Decomposition timer** — logs progress through decay stages attracting different species. "Turn" compost to reveal hidden beetles |
| 7 | **Wetland/Marsh** | Cattails, bulrushes, boardwalk over shallow pool, sedge meadow | Emperor Dragonfly, Banded Demoiselle, Halloween Pennant, Mayfly | **Emergence watching** — dragonfly nymphs crawl out and molt into adults. Water quality indicator affects species rarity |
| 8 | **Desert/Arid Garden** | Sun-bleached sand, prickly pear, agave, heat shimmer | Sacred Scarab, Band-Winged Grasshopper, Velvet Ant, Ant Lion | **Heat shimmer photography** — golden hour yields bonus quality. Temperature gauge determines active species |
| 9 | **Orchard** | Gnarled apple and cherry trees, blossom-laden branches, fallen fruit | Red Admiral, Comma, Codling Moth, Spotted Lanternfly | **Blossom cycle** — trees progress bud → bloom → fruit → fall; different insects at each stage. Fallen fruit attracts different species |
| 10 | **Rock Garden/Alpine** | Stacked slate and granite, cushion alpine flowers, wide bright sky | Apollo Butterfly, Alpine Longhorn Beetle, Mountain Bumblebee | **Sun-basking mechanic** — position rocks to create sun-traps. Short growing season restricts alpine insects to summer |
| 11 | **Night Garden** | Moonlit garden of pale blooms — moonflower, jasmine, evening primrose | Luna Moth, Cecropia Moth, Synchronous Firefly, Blue Ghost Firefly | **Day/night toggle** — only active at night. UV moth sheet setup. Light pollution meter: reducing bright lights increases rare moth spawns |
| 12 | **Rooftop/Urban** | City rooftop with container planters, sedum roof, skyline backdrop | Leafcutter Bee, Sweat Bee, Migrant Hawker Dragonfly | **Bee hotel management** — different tube diameters attract different bees. Wind mechanic: butterflies struggle on windy days |
| 13 | **Tropical Greenhouse** | Glass-domed conservatory, orchids, passion vines, misting system | Blue Morpho, Atlas Moth, Orchid Mantis, Hercules Beetle, Orchid Bee | **Emergence chamber** — watch chrysalises hatch. Mist cycles affect activity. Fruit feeding station must be stocked. Endgame capstone |

## 11. Eight seasonal events create limited-time spectacles

Each event is grounded in a real-world insect phenomenon and translates directly into compelling time-limited gameplay.

**Event 1: Monarch Migration (14 days, late September).** Waves of monarchs pass through all zones. Players photograph roosting clusters at dusk. Milkweed planting mini-quest increases spawn rate. "Tag-and-release" mechanic: tag monarchs and receive a postcard when they arrive in Mexico. Reward: gold-edged "Super Generation" monarch variant.

**Event 2: Firefly Season (10 days, early June).** Night Garden transforms. Players identify species by flash pattern (double-flash, triple-flash, continuous glow). Long-exposure mode only — flash photography disabled. Culminates in a synchronized firefly light show on the final night. Reward: bioluminescence photo filter.

**Event 3: Periodical Cicada Emergence (7 days, rare spring).** Emergence holes appear around tree bases. Volume meter shows the chorus building as billions emerge. Photography challenge captures the full nymph → molt → adult sequence. Exuviae collectibles cling to tree trunks. Reward: "17-Year Waiting" achievement, unique ambient soundscape.

**Event 4: Mayfly Hatch (5 days, early June).** Wetland and Pond zones erupt at dusk. Time-limited photography window each evening. Players capture spinner falls, aerial mating swarms, and fish rising to feed. Water quality meter must be maxed for the largest hatches. Reward: "Ephemeral Beauty" golden-hour photo filter.

**Event 5: Painted Lady Irruption (7 days, surprise).** Unannounced event mirroring real-world unpredictability. Painted ladies suddenly flood all zones in massive numbers. Speed photography challenge — they don't linger. Migration tracker logs sightings across zones. Reward: "Storm of Wings" photo frame, weather radar Easter egg showing the butterfly swarm.

**Event 6: National Moth Week (9 days, late July).** Players set up moth light stations (white sheet + UV lamp) in any zone. Different zones attract different species. Moth identification quiz tests wing patterns and antennae shapes. Community goal: collective moth count. Reward: UV lamp decoration, moth wing macro-photo filter.

**Event 7: Ladybug Aggregation (10 days, October).** Ladybugs gather in Rock Garden and Forest Floor zones. Players create overwintering sites (log piles, rock crevices) to attract larger clusters. Macro challenge: identify different species within a cluster. Pheromone trail minigame leads to hidden aggregation sites. Reward: animated "ladybug cluster" decoration.

**Event 8: Dragonfly Migration (10 days, September).** Green darners and migratory dragonflies appear across water zones. Cold-front weather system triggers migration waves. Fast-capture mechanic for in-flight shots. Isotope tracking minigame determines each dragonfly's birthplace. Reward: "Green Lightning" motion-blur photo filter.

## 12. Behavior-driven mechanics ground gameplay in real entomology

These twelve real insect behaviors translate into distinct, teachable game mechanics that reward observation and patience.

**Firefly flash synchronization.** Synchronous fireflies flash in coordinated waves. Players match flash sequences to identify species via a rhythmic minigame. Different flash patterns (double-pulse, slow glow, rapid strobe) correspond to different species.

**Ant trail formation.** Leafcutter ants follow pheromone paths. Players can place food sources to redirect trails and photograph ants carrying leaf pieces. Trail disruption and reformation creates dynamic photo opportunities.

**Metamorphosis stages.** Players track egg → larva → pupa → adult for key species (Monarch, Swallowtails, Cecropia). Each stage is a separate photo opportunity. Caterpillar identification challenges teach which larva becomes which adult.

**Mimicry identification.** Hoverflies mimic bees, Viceroy mimics Monarch, Clearwing moths mimic wasps. "Spot the Mimic" challenges reward players for correctly distinguishing model from mimic. Key tell: wing count (flies have 2, bees have 4).

**Camouflage searching.** Leaf insects, walking sticks, peppered moths, and katydids blend into backgrounds. Players scan scenes carefully to find hidden insects. A "thermal vision" upgrade reveals camouflaged creatures temporarily.

**Bee waggle dance decoder.** Players observe honeybees performing the waggle dance at a glass observation hive. A directional compass overlay appears. Successfully decoding the dance reveals the location of a rare flower patch in another zone.

**Cicada chorusing.** A directional microphone attachment records cicada calls. Different species produce different waveform patterns. Matching recorded calls to species earns "Acoustic ID" bonuses.

**Mud-puddling station.** Players create mineral-rich mud puddles to attract congregations of butterflies. Adding salt (craftable item) increases attractiveness. Photographing 5+ species at one puddle earns "Puddle Party" achievement.

**Moth light attraction.** Players set up UV lights and white sheets in the Night Garden. Different light wavelengths attract different moth families. Moths spiral in with realistic phototactic flight paths.

**Water strider ripple detection.** Dropping items (leaf, seed) onto pond surfaces creates ripples that attract water striders. Macro-lens mode reveals surface tension dimples under their feet.

**Dung beetle celestial navigation.** In the Compost zone at night, a starfield overlay appears and dung beetles orient toward the Milky Way. Players guide beetle paths by placing obstacles. "Celestial Navigator" achievement for night photos.

**Butterfly blossom-cycle timing.** Different insects arrive at different stages of fruit tree bloom (bud → flower → fruit → decay). Red Admirals and Commas prefer rotting fallen fruit. Mason bees prefer blossoms. Planning the orchard lifecycle maximizes species encounters.

## 13. Twenty plant-insect pairings create puzzle-like attraction requirements

These relationships range from **obligate** (insect requires the plant; no plant = no insect) to **strong preferential** (plant dramatically increases encounter rate). They form the core progression puzzle: "What do I need to plant to attract this species?"

### Obligate relationships (no plant, no insect)

| Plant | Insect | Relationship | Game Mechanic |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Milkweed (*Asclepias*) | Monarch butterfly | Sole caterpillar host plant | Plant milkweed to unlock Monarchs. Prerequisite for Migration event. "No milkweed = no monarchs" is the game's first obligate lesson |
| Yucca | Yucca Moth | Co-obligate — only pollinator of yucca; yucca is only host | Plant yucca in Desert zone. Multi-step photo sequence of pollination cycle. "Perfect Partners" achievement |
| Fig tree (*Ficus*) | Fig Wasp | Co-obligate, 60-million-year partnership. Each fig species has its own wasp | Plant fig in Tropical Greenhouse. Cutaway view mini-game shows wasp lifecycle inside fig. "60 Million Years" journal entry |
| Pipevine (*Aristolochia*) | Pipevine Swallowtail | Sole caterpillar host; sequesters toxins | Plant pipevine on trellis in Forest zone. Bonus: once present, mimics (Spicebush Swallowtail, Red-spotted Purple) also start appearing |
| Pawpaw tree (*Asimina*) | Zebra Swallowtail | Sole caterpillar host | Plant pawpaw in Forest zone (shade-tolerant). "Tropical in Appalachia" journal note |
| Passionflower (*Passiflora*) | Gulf Fritillary + Zebra Longwing | Near-obligate caterpillar host | One vine attracts 2–3 butterfly species. High-value planting. Exotic bloom is also a photography subject |

### Strong preferential relationships

| Plant | Insect | Relationship | Game Mechanic |
|-------|--------|-------------|---------------|
| Parsley / dill / fennel (Apiaceae) | Black Swallowtail | Caterpillar host family | Plant herbs in Herb Garden. Observe "parsley worm" caterpillar. Photograph osmeterium (forked orange defense organ) for "Secret Weapon" bonus |
| Stinging nettle | Red Admiral + European Peacock + Comma | Shared caterpillar host | A "pest plant" that unlocks three butterfly species. Teaches that gardens need wild corners |
| Spicebush (*Lindera*) | Spicebush Swallowtail | Primary caterpillar host | Plant in Forest zone. Caterpillar's snake-mimic eyespots are a must-photograph. "Nature's Deception" journal |
| Hickory / walnut / sweetgum | Luna Moth | Preferred caterpillar hosts | Plant in Forest zone. Luna moths appear at night in brief 2–3 night windows, simulating 1-week adult lifespan. "Emerald Ghost" page |
| Thistles (*Cirsium*) | Painted Lady | Primary caterpillar host | Plant in Meadow. During irruption events, thistle density determines swarm size |
| Honeysuckle / bedstraw | Hummingbird Hawk-Moth | Caterpillar host + nectar source | Plant in Herb Garden. Moth hovers at flowers during the day. "Not a Bird!" journal entry |
| Ragwort | Cinnabar Moth | Near-obligate caterpillar host | Plant in Meadow. Toxic relationship: caterpillar stores plant poisons. Iconic yellow-and-black striped caterpillar |
| Wild violets (*Viola*) | Great Spangled Fritillary | Exclusive caterpillar host | Violets must persist through fall/winter for overwintering caterpillar. "Winter Sleeper" journal |
| Oak / maple (deciduous trees) | Polyphemus Moth + Cecropia Moth | Preferred caterpillar hosts | Mature trees in Forest/Orchard zones unlock giant silk moths at night. Wing-flash mechanic for eyespot reveals |
| Lamb's ear (*Stachys*) | Wool Carder Bee | Fiber source for nesting | Plant in Herb Garden. Watch bees scrape plant hairs. Males patrol aggressively — dynamic photo ops |
| Roses | Leafcutter Bee + Japanese Beetle + Rose Chafer | Attraction hub | Multiple species converge. Leafcutter "cookie-cutter" holes in leaves are visual evidence of bee activity |
| Acacia tree | Acacia Ant | Co-obligate mutualism | Plant in Tropical Greenhouse. Ants patrol and defend tree from pests. Interaction mini-game. "Armed Partnership" journal |
| Fruit trees (apple, cherry) | Orchard Mason Bee + Red Admiral + Comma | Blossom-cycle dependent | Trees cycle through stages; different insects at each. Fallen fruit mechanic attracts fruit-feeding butterflies |
| Sunflowers / asters (Asteraceae) | Long-Horned Bee + many pollinators | Strong pollen attraction | Plant in Meadow. Males fly searching patterns near flowers. Late-summer specialist |

## 14. Rarity distribution and design balance across the full catalog

Across all **109 species**, the rarity distribution maintains a healthy pyramid: many common encounters to keep gameplay rewarding, with increasingly rare finds to sustain long-term engagement.

| Rarity | Count | Percentage | Design Role |
|--------|-------|------------|-------------|
| Common | 36 | 33% | Always present. Teaches core mechanics. First journal pages |
| Uncommon | 40 | 37% | Requires specific plants or zones. Mid-game progression |
| Rare | 16 | 15% | Zone-specific or behavior-dependent. Significant achievements |
| Very Rare | 10 | 9% | Exotic zones, night-only, or event-dependent. Trophy photographs |
| Legendary | 7 | 6% | Endgame capstones. Orchid Mantis, Leaf Insect, Queen Alexandra's Birdwing, Hercules Beetle, Comet Moth, Sunset Moth, and event-only spawns |

**Active period breakdown:** **62 species day-active**, **28 night-active**, **19 dawn-dusk/crepuscular**. This ensures robust content for both day and night gameplay loops, with night content weighted toward moths, beetles, crickets, and the Night Garden zone.

**Movement pattern diversity:** Flutter (31), crawl (20), hover (14), patrol/darting (13), purposeful-line (7), erratic (6), lazy drift (7), hop (4), swim-glide (4), buzz-hover (3). This range ensures no two zones feel identical in terms of camera challenge.

## Conclusion: a living garden that teaches real ecology

This catalog of **109 species** across 13 zones provides roughly 2–3 months of collection-driven gameplay before a player encounters every species. The **obligate plant-insect pairings** create genuine puzzle mechanics grounded in ecology ("Why won't Monarchs visit? Because I haven't planted milkweed"). The **8 seasonal events** provide recurring spectacles that mirror real-world phenomena, and the **12 behavior mechanics** transform passive observation into active participation.

Three design principles emerged from the research that deserve emphasis. First, **sound should be a first-class mechanic** — crickets, cicadas, fireflies, and wing-buzz create an acoustic layer that most insect games ignore. Second, **night gameplay is a massive untapped opportunity**: 28 species require darkness, and moth-sheeting alone could carry an entire sub-game. Third, the **mimicry and camouflage mechanics** (hoverflies mimicking bees, katydids disguised as leaves, peppered moths on bark) add an identification meta-game that rewards repeat visits and growing expertise.

The geographic diversity spans six continents, ensuring that players encounter familiar backyard insects alongside exotic tropical species. Every entry is fact-checked against entomological sources, and every fun fact can serve as a journal entry that teaches real science — making Project Flutter a game that's as educational as it is cozy.
